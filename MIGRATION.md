# Migration from bootstrap 3 to 4


## Navbar
- body class `navbar-xs-open` changed to `navbar-show` if navbar is open
- body class `navbar-open` added for immediately css transition support
- added `open` class to `.navbar-collapse` for immediately css transition
- open nav-dropdowns now have class `show` instead of `open` if active
